 The video is consist of three parts, all are the comparative experiments results on several sequences of our KITTI object tracking  validation datasets. The first part is the results of DODT(T=3) and AVOD, which shows the overall improvements of DODT compared with original AVOD.  The second part is the results of DODT(T=3) and DODT(T=1), which demonstrates the effect of temporal stride T on our model performance. And the last part is the results of DODT(T=3) and Based_DODT(T=3), which shows the contribution of Temporal module and MoI algorithm on object detection and tracking performance.
